# PS4: Sokoban Game
## Contact

## Description
This project implements a tile-based Sokoban game where the player pushes boxes into designated storage locations. This program is a full game with added gameplay mechanics like player movement, box pushing, detecting win conditions, and the ability to reset the game or replay the level.

### Features
For this assignment, I chose not to use dynamically allocated assets, as they didnâ€™t seem necessary given the project scope. Instead, I organized the textures in a map for easy access, and used a vector of vectors to store the level layout. I designed a custom structure, Grid, to maintain the game state, making it more modular and manageable. Additionally, I stored the textures in a static member variable, allowing them to be shared across multiple instances of the class. This setup would enable drawing multiple levels simultaneously if needed.

### Memory
I chose to store the level as a 2D vector of characters, using each character to represent a specific tile. Textures were organized in a map, with each character mapped directly to its corresponding texture, allowing quick access to textures based on the character index. To manage the game state, I created a Grid struct that maintains the positions of all tiles that need to be drawn, each stored in separate vectors. Within the class, I used a stack of Grid instances to track the game state, making it straightforward to implement undo and reset functions. I decided not to use smart pointers, as they were not necessary for completing this assignment.

### Lambdas
I used lambdas in conjunction with algorithm library functions in the Draw function to draw the different sprites in the correct locations.

### Issues
I encountered issues with handling box movement, especially ensuring that the player could push only one box at a time and that boxes moved only when there was an open space behind them, but i resolved it. I had some issues at the beginning but managed to fix them all before the submission deadline. Currently trying to implement the victory sign display and a winning buzzer sound for when the player wins the game.

### Extra Credit
I successfully added a timer that is displayed on the top of the window as it records the time passed since the game started in MM:SS format. Added an undo feature as well that will undo a move every time you press 'U' unless it is the first move. The player changes direction while moving.
